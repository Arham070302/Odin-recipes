    A journey of a rice dish that began from Persia (modern day Iran) and ended in your plate. Wondering what we are talking about? We are talking about the evergreen classic rice dish that literally needs no introduction. Still wondering? We are talking about Biryani. The exact origin of biryani is uncertain. Though it may appear to be a dish associated to India, in reality the dish originated quite far away. There are many theories about how biryani made its way to India, Indian restaurateur Kris Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia, and was brought to India by the Mughals.

<h2>What is Biriyani?</h2>

<p>
    Biryani is a popular rice dish preparation that is savored across India. Prepared in 100s of styles that vary from region to region. For biryani, special quality basmati rice or a long grain rice is used with rich spices and aromas. If you ask me to explain what biryani looks and smells like, I would describe it as a rice preparation that consists of long grain aromatic rice colored with saffron, with a burst of aromas glistening in the luxury of ghee (clarified butter) prepared with fine quality spices that takes a generous amount of time and hard work to prepare and takes just a few minutes to finish it.

Add remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the skillet and fry onion, garlic and ginger until onion is soft and golden. Add chili, pepper, turmeric, cumin, salt and the tomatoes. Fry, stirring constantly for 5 minutes. Add yogurt, mint, cardamom and cinnamon stick. Cover and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally until the tomatoes are cooked to a pulp. It may be necessary to add a little hot water if the mixture becomes too dry and starts to stick to the pan.
