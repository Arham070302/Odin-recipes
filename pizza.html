<h2><u>pizza facts and history</u></h2>

<p>
    The further back we look in time, the more interesting details we can find about that surrounds pizza. Today this dish is one of the most popular foods on the entire Earth, but that fame and recognition came from the decades of work of many international pizza restaurant franchises which spread this dish to the all four corners of the world. Before these pizza chains were formed, this dish slowly rose in popularity in the United Stated, brought from the Europe by the Italian settlers which did not wanted to be parted from one of the most iconic meals of their country. And there, in the Mediterranean coastal city of Naples, the modern Pizza was created.

    Although 19th century Italy is regarded as a home of modern pizza, it roots go all the way back to the ancient Roman, Greek and Persian empires. The records from those times depict various types of bread in round and flat shapes, with various toppings on top. Although many European civilizations continued to use meals created in this fashion even up to today(coca from Catalonia and Valencia, Greek Pita, Turkish Pide,Lepinja or Solmun in Balkans), the cooks from Italy became most interested in pizza. They produced various pizza products from the ancient times to the middle ages. In the preserved ruins of the Italian city of Pompei, archeologist found unmistakable signs of the network that supported pizza production – from the street stands to the restaurant kitchens were pizzas were made. Most important ingredient that elevated local Italian dish to the worldwide famous pizza was arrival of the tomato from the New World in 16th century. Although Italian nobility regarded tomato as a poor man’s food, the inventive recipes and designs of Italian pizza cooks from Naples soon managed to change their minds. As the popularity of the pizza grew, pizza makers started to expand their business. The first restaurant dedicated only for selling pizza was opened in Naples in 1830, and after that many more appeared across all Italy. The pizza from witch almost all designs are based was created in the 1889 by the hands of the famous Naples chef Raffaele Esposito who made three pizzas for the King and Queen of Italy. His design of pizza Margherita became gold standard for all future pizzas.

    <h2><strong>steps:</strong></h2>



<ol>

    <li>Take the flour an weigh off 300 grams using the weighing scale.
        Take the flour and add it to the bowl.
        Add the yeast, salt, and water to it.
        Start to knead the mixture.
        During this process add olive oil to the dough, until it gets smooth and a little moist.
        Knead it for about 5 minutes. This way the ingredients get well mixed and it will be smoother.
        Once finished put it back in the bowl and cover it with a cloth. Place the covered dough on a warm spot (heater for example) and leave it there for about 45 minutes. It will grow significantly during this time period. It is important that you put it in a warm spot.</li>

    <li>To make the sauce you will need to take the vegetables first. Peel the skin of the onion and of the garlic. Then cut them into cubes. Put them aside and take the tomatoes. If your tomatoes are soft, you can only cut them in halves. If not, cut them into cubes as well. Put some oil into a pan and heat it up. Once the oil is hot you can add the onion and garlic to it. cook it until the onions are glassy. Then add the tomatoes to it. After a while they should be squashy enough to take the spoon and sqish them. This will give you the sauce. Add the chili to the sauce and let it cook for a while. Optionally you can add tomato paste, but it is not needed primarily.</li>
    
    <li>To roll out the dough you need to make sure that you cover the surface you use for rolling out the dough with flour first. This way the dough will not stick to the surface of the table. Also put some flour on the rolling pin, so that the dough does not stick to the rolling pin. Then you tame the dough and put it on your surface. Use the rolling pin to flatten out the dough. Turn the dough around once and then, to flatten it from both sides, and to make sure that it does not stick to the surface.

        After you have rolled out the dough until it is big enough to cover your baking tray, or thin enough, take the dough and place it on the baking tray. Use your hands to fold over the edges of the dough, so that you create a crust. You are then ready to put the topping on the pizza.</li>
    
        <li>You will start of with cutting the mozzarella into slices. These should be thin, so that you can cover as much space as possible with the cheese. Place the cheese on the sauce. cut the salami, pepper and onion into slices as well. Place the salami first, and then add the onion and the pepper on top of the mozzarella. To finish off, add the olives. Add as many as you want. The topping depends fully on your taste and preferences. You could use whatever you want for a pizza topping. You are then finished with the preparation process. The next step is to bake the pizza.</li>
    
    
        <li>Once the topping is put on the pizza you can now bake it. Heat up the oven on 200°C. After the oven has gained the temperature insert the pizza on the baking tray and let it cook for approximately 15 minutes. The time the pizza will need to be cooked can vary. It depends on the thickness of the bottom and crust, the temperature etc. Just take a look after 15 minutes and check regularly afterwards, until your pizza looks the way you like it.

            After you cooked it, take it out of the oven, cut it into pieces and go ahead and eat it.
            
            Bon appetite!
